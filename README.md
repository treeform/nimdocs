![Github Actions](https://github.com/treeform/nimdocs/workflows/Github%20Actions/badge.svg)

[API reference](https://nimdocs.com/treeform/nimdocs)

## About

I got tried of building Nim docs for all of my many projects. I created this site that auto generates the docs for me based on the URL. Going to https://nimdocs.com/treeform/pixie will just clone the https://github.com/treeform/pixie repo and generate the docs.

If you want to be included in the allowed authors list, open a pull request.

## Features:

* Check if the docs are up to date with GitHub.
* Clone new repositories automatically.
* Add source links back to github.com.
* Generates docs for all files in the repo.
